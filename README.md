# ECE1512_project

This project is a simple appraoch to generating latex markup from equations image of handwritten equations image provided in the dataset- CHORME. Since the handwritten dataset of equations image is not very big I have attempted to use transfer learning by using a trained CNN on the character dataset provided by Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols. For more details refer to the report ece1512_report.pdf.
